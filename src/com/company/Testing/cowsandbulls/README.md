# Cows and Bulls

Create a class what is capable of playing exactly one game of
[Cows and Bulls (CAB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows). The player
have to guess a 4 digit number. For every digit that the player guessed
correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the player
guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” If the player types a number
that does not exist, that guess will not have any result.

Example: If the number to be found is "7624" and the player types "7296", the
result is: "1 cow, 2 bull".

- The CAB object should have a random 4 digit number, which is the goal to
  guess.
- The CAB object should have a state where the game state is stored (`playing`,
  `finished`).
- The CAB object should have a counter where it counts the guesses.
- The CAB object should have a guess method, which returns a string of the guess
  result
- All methods, including constructor should be tested
